# Project: Leveraging Cisco Foundation AI for Incident Detection & Response

## Objective
Explore how a retail enterprise SOC could leverage Cisco Foundation AI to:  
- Improve incident detection and correlation  
- Reduce false positives  
- Enable predictive security capabilities  
- Enhance SOC efficiency with AI-driven workflows  

---

## Key Activities & Milestones

| Week | Milestone / Deliverable |
|------|--------------------------|
| 1–2  | Research Cisco Foundation AI capabilities, APIs, and integration pathways (e.g., SIEM, EDR, NDR) |
| 3    | Identify infrastructure compatibility requirements |
| 4–5  | Propose potential SOC use cases: early detection, anomaly correlation, analyst efficiency |
| 6–7  | Build proof-of-concept (POC) design for AI-driven alert pipeline & triage workflow |
| 8    | Draft technical recommendations for architecture alignment and automation roadmap |
| 9    | Deliver final presentation & demo of solution (sanitized demo version included here) |

---

## Expected Deliverables
- Use Case Matrix → Strategic applications of Cisco Foundation AI in SOC workflows  
- Technical Whitepaper → Integration possibilities, data flow, automation potential  
- POC / Workflow Mockup → AI-driven detection pipeline demo with mock alerts  

---

## Stretch Goals
- Correlate identity-based anomalies across multiple tools (EDR, NDR, SaaS security)  
- Draft a playbook for AI-assisted incident escalation  
- Recommend metrics for continuous SOC evaluation of the AI model’s performance  

---

## Example Workflow
1. Ingest alerts from multiple tools (EDR, NDR, SaaS logs)  
2. Normalize into a common schema  
3. Correlate alerts using shared indicators (IP, hostname, device ID, user ID)  
4. Apply AI enrichment:  
   - MITRE ATT&CK tagging  
   - Risk scoring (0–100)  
   - Confidence band (High/Medium/Low)  
   - Action-oriented analyst recommendation  
5. Surface enriched events in a dashboard with tabs for:  
   - Incidents list  
   - Correlation graph  
   - MITRE ATT&CK coverage  
   - Timeline view
